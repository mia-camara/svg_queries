svg_queries
===========

Playing with SVG and modifying elements internally when presented with media queries.

[Joe Harrison's][joe] [Responsive Logos][responsivelogos] is an interesting experiment involving SVG sprites and a responsive layout. Related to his [Responsive Icons Project][rip] it demonstrates how a logo might change at different screen sizes. Elements adjusting and shrinking to fit the space. 

Some questions that have been rolling around the old knoggin for a while were, 

* Are there alternatives that don't simply migrate a raster sprite sheet to a vector one?
* What built in features can we use to minimize code? Will they work across browsers?
* How much work is involved after exporting an image from a grpahics program?

Considering I haven't had a blog in a while sharing the result on GitHub seems to be a decent solution.
